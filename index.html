        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        Wysper-msg is a messaging application that allows you to store your conversations 
        on your own server. 
        <br>
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        Wysper is installed as a Client application and a Server application separately. 
        <br>
        The server administrator for your chat launches the wysper-server application and gives the ip address and port 
        to anyone they want to be able to join the chat.
        <br>
        Clients can launch the client application and connect using the server administrators ip address and port.
        <br>
        <h3>Installation</h3>
        To use Wysper, first clone our release repository at https://github.com/wysper-msg/downloads
        <h4>Server</h4>
        To run the server, find the run.sh file in the Server folder of the cloned repository <br>
        Edit the file and enter your port and any other configuration options you may want. <br><br>
        Finally, run <code>./run.sh</code> to run the server. <br><br>
        Check out <a href="https://github.com/wysper-msg/downloads/Server/README.txt">The server README</a> for more information!
        <h4>Client</h4>
        To run the client, enter the Client/wysper-client folder and run java -jar client.jar to run the client. <br><br>
        Once the client is started, you can enter the server's ip address and port to connect and start sending messages!
